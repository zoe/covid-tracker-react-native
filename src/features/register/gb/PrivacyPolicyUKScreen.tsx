            This page explains how we process information about individual people, known as “personal data”, that we
            collect through our COVID monitoring app. If you are using the app and entering your own personal data, then
            this applies to you. We may also be processing your personal data if someone else – a family member or
            parent or guardian or member of your household – has entered it on your behalf, see the section headed
            “recording information for others” for more information about this.

            We process two kinds of information about you:

          <RegularBoldText>Sensitive personal data</RegularBoldText>
          <RegularText>
            This is information about you, your health and your symptoms if unwell. It includes:

            Our legal basis for processing it is that you consented to our doing so. Because of the tight regulatory
            requirements placed on us, we need your consent to process data about your health, which means that if you
            do not consent (or withdraw your consent), we cannot allow you to use the app. This is not meant unkindly,
            we are simply not able to provide you with the service without your consent.
            {'\n\n'}
            We share this data with people doing health research, for example, people working in:

          <RegularText>
            A full list of institutions we have shared data with can be found at the bottom of this page. An anonymous
            code is used to replace your personal details when we share this with researchers outside the NHS or King's
            College London.
            {'\n\n'}
            Before sharing any of your data with researchers outside of the UK, we will remove your name, phone number,
            email address and the last 3 digits of your post code to protect your privacy.
            {'\n\n'}
            Because of the nature of the research we carry out, we are unable to set any particular time limit on the
            storage of your sensitive personal data, but we will keep it under regular review and ensure that it is not
            kept longer than is necessary.
            {'\n\n'}
            If you wish us to stop processing your sensitive personal data, you may withdraw your consent at any time by
            emailing us at leavecovidtracking@joinzoe.com. When you withdraw your consent, we will delete all sensitive
            personal data we hold about you.

          <RegularBoldText>Recording information for others</RegularBoldText>
          <RegularText>
            The app also allows users to input information about other people in addition to their own by making a
            separate profile for them. If you do this and the other person is able to understand the concept of consent,
            for example if they are a mentally competent adult or mature child, then you must only do this if they have
            given their consent.
            {'\n\n'}
            Younger children may not be mature enough to give consent, but they may be able to understand what you are
            doing. If so, you should explain to them what you are doing and what may happen to information about them to
            the extent they are capable of understanding. You should also try to take into account their views, even if
            you make the ultimate decision. We trust you to know your child and to do what is appropriate given their
            level of maturity.{'\n'}

            school they attend, which bubble your child belongs to in addition to the other sensitive personal data
            collected by the app. We use this information in the same way we use other sensitive personal data, but in
