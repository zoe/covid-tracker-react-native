              King’s College London would like to invite you to participate in this research study which forms part of
              Covid-19 research. Before you decide whether you want to take part, it is important for you to understand
              why the research is being done and what your participation will involve. Please take time to read the
              following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Ask study researchers if there is
              anything that is not clear or if you would like more information by emailing us at{' '}

            <RegularBoldText>What is the purpose of the study?{'\n'}</RegularBoldText>
            <RegularText>
              The purpose of the study is to test the level of accuracy of computer software (sometimes called
              algorithms or prediction models) that could be used as a “digital test” to evaluate whether an individual
              is infected with Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2), based on their symptoms reported in the Covid Symptom Study app.
              This study is designed to establish how accurate this digital test is for different people. The potential
              benefit of a digital test is that it is simple to complete, it produces results quickly, and it can be
              accessed by a large proportion of the population, some of which have limited access to physical testing
              for Covid-19.
              {'\n\n'}
              Participants that develop new symptoms during the study may be asked to have a standard swab test for
              Covid-19, depending on test availability and your development of symptoms. The accuracy of the digital
              test will be evaluated by comparing its predictions with the results from an actual Covid-19 swab test.
              {'\n\n'}
              This study therefore aims to evaluate the use of this digital test as a diagnostic tool for Covid-19
              infection.

            <RegularBoldText>Why have I been invited to take part?{'\n'}</RegularBoldText>

            <RegularText>
              You are being invited to participate in this study because you are already using the UK-version of the
              Covid-19 Symptom Study app to report your own health, are at least 18 years of age, have reported in the
              app that you live in the UK, and you have not reported testing positive from a previous Covid-19 test.
              {'\n'}
            </RegularText>

            <RegularBoldText>What will happen if I take part?{'\n'}</RegularBoldText>

            <RegularText>
              If you choose to take part in this study, you may be asked to have a Covid-19 swab test, and to report
              your test result in the app. Taking part requires you to continue reporting in the app and eligibility for
              swab testing will be determined by app reporting. If you are asked to be tested, it does not mean we think
              you have Covid-19.
              {'\n\n'}
              On behalf of King’s College London, Zoe Global Ltd (Zoe, the creator of the Covid-19 Symptom Study app)
              will oversee the arrangements for swab testing. All swab testing will be managed by the Department of
              Health. You will receive instructions from Zoe in the app or by email, on how to organise your swab test,
              either by ordering a testing kit in the mail or visiting a Regional Testing Centre. Alternatively, Zoe may
              apply for testing on your behalf to the Department of Health and Social Care, through an online platform
              where Zoe will share your name, mobile phone number, and email address to register you for testing. Swab
              testing involves collecting a sample to test if you have COVID by inserting a long swab (like a long
              cotton wool bud) into the back of your nose or mouth and rotating the swab several times. Organising and
              completing the Covid-19 test is optional. Once you have received your test result, you will be asked to
              report it in the Covid-19 Symptom Study app.
              {'\n\n'}
              The researchers conducting this study have been granted the allowance to test up to 10,000 individuals per
              week in this way. This number of swab tests may be insufficient to test all the participants in this study
              who qualify for testing. Participants who are eligible for swab testing, but do not complete their test or
              do not report their test result, may receive feedback on the likelihood that they have SARS-CoV-2 based on
              their individual reported symptoms as predicted by the prediction model. These predictions will be
              communicated to the participant using the app on behalf of researchers at King’s College London.

            <RegularText>
              Participation is completely voluntary. You should only take part if you want to and choosing not to take
              part will not disadvantage you in anyway. You do not need to participate in this study in order to
              continue to use the app. Once you have read the information sheet, please contact us if you have any
              questions that will help you make a decision about taking part. If you decide to take part we would ask
              you to complete the consent form below and you will receive an electronic copy of this consent form to
              keep.
