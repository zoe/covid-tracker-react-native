            We are unable today to set any particular time limit on the storage of your sensitive personal data, but we

            example, we currently collect your name so that we are able to pass this on to health care professionals if
            it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another person. Once this is no
            longer required, we will delete all names from our records. In contrast, data about the spread of the virus
            is likely to be extremely valuable for researchers studying both this virus and in understanding epidemic
            spread for the future. We are likely, therefore, to retain this information for much longer
            {'\n\n'}
            In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal

            Under the GDPR you have a number of important rights with respect to your Personal Data, including those set
            forth below. For more information about these rights, or to submit a request, please email us at
            dpo@joinzoe.com. Please note that in some circumstances, we may not be able to fully comply with your
            request, such as if it is frivolous or extremely impractical, if it jeopardizes the rights of others, or if
            it is not required by law, but in those circumstances, we will still respond to notify you of such a
            decision. In some cases, we may also need to you to provide us with additional information, which may
            include Personal Data, if necessary to verify your identity and the nature of your request.
